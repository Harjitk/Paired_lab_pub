# pairing_lab_pub

The purpose of this paired lab was to practice creating mutiple classes in Ruby and applying Test Driven Development (TDD) 
to ensure our code worked effectively. 
This task required me to work with my partner to write one piece of code. This involved knowledge sharing and continuous
review of code.
